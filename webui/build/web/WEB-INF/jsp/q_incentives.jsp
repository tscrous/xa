    <p style="color: rgb(240, 240, 240); text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 12px;">The following government and/or industry specific incentives may be applicable to you :</p>
    
    <h2>Government incentives</h2>
    <p>
        The South African Government provides support for private sector investment projects through a wide range 
        of support programmes primarily managed by the Department of Trade and Industry.
    </p>
    <p>
        Support programmes are aligned to Government's National Industrial Policy Framework ("NIPF") and aims to encourage 
        key issues including fixed capital investment, direct foreign investment, capacity building, employment creation, 
        skills development, infrastructure development, exports, Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment, SMME development, etc.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Business process outsourcing and off shoring</h2>
    <p>
        The BPO and O investment incentive is offered to local and foreign investors establishing projects that aim primarily 
        to serve offshore clients by investing in facilities like call centres. The programme comprises an investment grant 
        ranging between R37 000 and R60 000 per seat and a training support grant towards costs of company specific training 
        up to a maximum of R12 000 per call centre agent. The objective of the incentive is to attract BPO and O investments 
        that create employment and skills development opportunities.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Film incentive</h2>
    <p>
        The South African Government has introduced a revised film and television production incentive which comprises of the 
        Foreign Film and Television Production Incentive, and the South African Film and Television Production and Co-Production Incentive. 
        The incentive is intended to increase local content generation and improve location competitiveness for filming in South Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Foreign Film and Television Production Incentive is only available to foreign- owned qualifying productions with 
        Qualifying South African Production Expenditure (QSAPE) of R12 million and above. An eligible applicant will be rebated 
        a sum totalling 15% of the QSAPE and the rebate is capped at R10 million.
    </p>
    <p>
        The South African Film and Television Production Incentive provides financial assistance to local productions in the form 
        of a rebate of up to 35% of the Qualifying South African Production Expenditure (QSAPE). The rebate will be capped at R10 million.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Motor industry development programme</h2>
    <p>
        The MIDP is an extensive support programme aimed at the development of a sustainable, globally competitive automotive industry. 
        The programme encourages local manufacturers of light and heavy vehicles, as well as component manufacturers, to become global suppliers. 
        Currently support takes the form of import duty credits earned on local content contained in exported product as well as import duty 
        credits earned on fixed investment in local production facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Import duty credits can be applied to offset import duties on niche / low volume products, allowing local production to focus on 
        high volume product ranges, achieving economies of scale and ensuring global competitiveness and long term viability. 
        The MIDP is arguably the most successful industry specific support programme ever launched by the South African Government.
    </p>
    <p>
        The current MIDP will be replaced in 2013 by the newly announced Automotive Production Development Programme (APDP) 
        which will be in place until 2020.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Textile and clothing industry development programme</h2>
    <p>
        The objective of the TCIDP is to influence and encourage textile and clothing manufacturers to compete internationally, independent 
        of government subsidies. The programme allows manufacturers to earn 'duty credits' on the export of certain clothing and textile products. 
        As a result specialisation in export products is encouraged whilst the participant's domestic product range can be broadened by 
        importing additional goods duty free, using duty credits earned in terms of the programme.
