    <h1>Facing duty increases</h1>
    <p>
        Being on the receiving end of a duty increase, anti-dumping application or other protective measure can be a frightening experience. 
        Time is extremely limited and putting a foot wrong can be catastrophic. 
        The complex legal structure and the very short time frames make it very difficult to oppose such applications.
