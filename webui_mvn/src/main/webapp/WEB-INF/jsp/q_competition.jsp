    <h1>Facing import competition</h1>
    <p>
        Local manufacturers seldom have a good grip on the state of their import competition until its too late. 
        In addition, even being aware of the state of competition does not mean that the manufacturer clearly understands what can be done to improve this position. 
        The first step to managing the risk posed by importers is to closely monitor what is happening in that space. 
        XA developed a software solution called <b style="color: white;">Stratalyze</b> which is designed to help importers monitor the position in their specific market.

        Once you understand your competitive position, you can move forward into taking a proactive stance. 
        There are a number of ways that this can be dealt with:
    </p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
        <li>Normal duty increase</li>
        <li>Anti-dumping application</li>
        <li>Countervailing application</li>
        <li>Safeguard application</li>
        <li>Effective utilization of non-tariff barriers</li>
    </ul>
